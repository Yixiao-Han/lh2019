## PDF studies

This is meant to study if using a quark/gluon discriminant to classify
the final-state helps constraining PDFs, in particular the gluon PDF
at large x

### 0-th order study

Just as a case study, one can try to see how correlated the iitial and
final-state flavours are. This is done here by simply looking at
dijets Born-level. This uses CT14nlo PDFs.

The details are in the [2to2](2to2) folder and the main results are in
[this file](2to2/fractions.pdf). In particular, page 4 shows the
contributions from qq and gg initial-state imposing that the final
state is gg (page 3 is the same for a qq final state). The bottom-line
is that the correlation between initial and final-state is large
(unless one looks at gg final-states at carzily large pt)
